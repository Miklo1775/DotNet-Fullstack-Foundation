Constructors

--What is a Constructor?
> Special methods used to initialize an object.
> Similar to a method that is invoked when an object of a class is created.
> Unlike methods, a constructor has the same name as the class and it also does not have a return type.

--Types of Contructors
> Default ==> A constructor with no parameters.
> Parameterized ==> A constructor that takes parameters.
> Copy ==> A constructor used to create an object by copying data from another object.
> Private ==> Once a constructor is private, we cannot create objects of class in other classes.
> Static ==> Used to initialize static fields or data and to only be executed once.

--Constructor Overloading
> Allows us to define multiple constructors for a class, each with a different set of parameters.
> Allows us to create object sof the class with different initial states, depending on the args passed down to the constructor.
> Makes code more flexible and reuseable.
