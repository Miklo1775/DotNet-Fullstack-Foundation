Inheritance

--What is Inheritance?
> In C#, its possible to inherit fields and methods from one class to another.
> Allows us to define a new class based on an existing class.
> The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class and can also add its add new properties and methdos of its own.
> This promotes code reuseability, simplifies code maintenance, and cleaner code organization.

--Types of Inheritance
> Single Inheritance:
	*Base/Super class is inherited by the derived class.
	*Derived class inherits properties and methods of Super class.
> Hierarchical Inheritance:
	*Base/Super class is inherited by 2 or more derived classes.
	*The derived classes inherit properties and methods from the Super class.
	*The derived classes don't share a relationship with each other.
> Multilevel and Hybrid Inheritance:
	*Base/Super class is inherited by an intermediary class.
	*Intermediary class inherits properties and methods from Super class.
	*Intermediary class is inherited by other derived classes.
	*Derived classes inherit properties and methods from both intermediary class and Super class.
> Multiple Inheritance:
	*Derived class inherits from 2 or more parent classes.
	*C# has no functionality on its own to achieve this, but we can use interfaces to achieve this effect.
