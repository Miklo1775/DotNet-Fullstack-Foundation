ASP.NET Core Forms


--What are Forms?
> Forms are a key part of building web applications.
> Allows users to submit data to the server which can be used to Create, Update, or Delete data or to perform other actions.
> Can be created using HTML helpers which are methods that generate HTML code that be used to display and interact with forms.
> The request is usually sent to the server as a POST request.

--Weakly-Typed Forms
> Refers to a way of handling form data where data is not explicity bound to a specific data model.
> Instead, the form data is accessed as a collection of key-value pairs where the key represents the names of the form fields and the values represent the user-inputs.
> The dev can access the data using the Request Object which allows the dev to read and manipulate the form data directly, without the need to create a specific data model.

--Strongly-Typed Forms
> Refers to a way of handling form data that is explicity bound to a specific data model.
> Allows devs to define a data model that corresponds to the structure of the form data and to use model binding to automatically map the form data to the data model.
> The developer can create a data model using a class or a structure that defines the properties and data types of the form fields.
> The form data is automatically mapped to the properties of the data model using model binding which provides compile-time validation and reduces the risk of runtime-errors.
