Model Binding


--What is Model Binding?
> A mechanism that extracts the data from an HTTP request and provides them to the controller action method parameters.
> This action method parameters may be simple types or complex types.
> When a client makes a request to a controller action method.
> ASP.NET Core automatically maps the data in the request to the action methods parameters using model binding.
> Model binding is a powerful feature that can simplify your code and reduce boilerplate.
> Example: 
	****
		public IActionResult UpdatePerson(Person person)
		{
			return View(person);
		}
	****
