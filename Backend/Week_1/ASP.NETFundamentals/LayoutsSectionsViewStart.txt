Layouts, Sections, and View Start

--Layout View
> Layouts are like the master pages in Webforms applications.
> Layouts define the common layout or structure of multiple views in an applicaton.
> Allows you to define a consisten layout or structure in your application such as a header, footer, and navigation menu.
> Used to define the structure of HTML page and may contain placeholders for the content that will be displayed by the views.

--Use of Layout View
> Most websites have the following sections:
	*Website Header
	*Website Footer
	*Navigation Menus
	*Main Content Area
> Instead of putting all the sections in each and every view page, it is always better and advisable to put them in a layout view and then inherit that layour view in each every view where your want that consistency.
