Session and State Management


--Session
> Sessions provide a way to store user-specific data across requests.
> Is a way to persist data between requests for the same user even if they close their browser or leave the application.
> When user visits a website, server creates a unique session ID, and sends it to the client in cookie.
> The client then includes this session ID in subsequent requests which allows the server to associate the requests with a specific session.
> ASP.NET Core provides a built-in ISession interface that represents a session object.
> Example:
	****
		public IActionResult Index()
		{
			HttpContext.Session.SetString("UserName", "John");
			return View();
		}
