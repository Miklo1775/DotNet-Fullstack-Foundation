View Bag and View Data



--ViewBag
> Used to transfer temporary data which is not included in the model from the controller to the view.
> Internally, it is a dynamic type property of the ControllerBase class which is the base class of the Controller class.
> Often used for simple scenarios where a strongly typed model is not required.
> Example:
		****
			@ViewBag.Name	<====>  @ViewBag.Name = "John"
				View					Controller
		****

--ViewData
> ViewData is used to pass the data from the controller action method to a view and we can display this data on the view.
> The ViewData works on the principle of key-value pairs.
> This type of binding is called loosely binding.
> We can pass any type of data.
> ViewData only transfers data from controller to view, not vice-versa. Only valid during the current request.
> Example:
		****
		@ViewData["Name"]   <=====>   @ViewData["Name"] = "John"
			View							Controller
		****
