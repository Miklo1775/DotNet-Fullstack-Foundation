Convention and Attribute Routing 



--Convention Routing
> Used for defining routes based on conventions and defaults rather than explicitly defining each route.
> Developers define a set of conventions that are used to generate routes for different types of controllers and actions.
> It provides a simple and flexible way to define routes in an ASP.NET Core application.
> The URL pattern is generated based on the names of the controller and action methods.

--Attribute Route
> Technique used for defining routes directly in the controller code using attributes.
> Developers can specify the URL pattern for a particular action method using attributes instead of relying on conventions or explicit route definitions.
> In attribute routing. [Route] is used to specify the URL pattern for the action method.
> By specifying the route directly in the controller code, developers can have fine-grained control over the URL patterns for each action method.
