--Action Methods
> A method that responds to user action/activity.
> Any method in a controller which has public access modifier acts as an action method.
> Similar to normal methods but with the following restrictions:
	*Action method must be public. It cannot be private or protected.
	*Action method cannot be overloaded.
	*Action method cannot be a static method.

--Default Action Methods
> Every Controller can have a default action method as per configured route in the RouteConfig.
> By default, the Index() method is a default action method for any controller.
> You can also change the default action name as per your requirement in the RouteConfig class.
> Syntax:
	****

		public IActionResult Index()
		{
			return View();
		}

--Action Result
> MVC Framework includes various Result classes, which can be returned from an action method.
> Result classes represents different types of responses, such as HTML, file, string, JSON, etc
> ActionResult class is a base class of all the above result classes so it can be the return type of action method that returns any result.
> However, you can specify the appropriate result class as a return type of action method.
> The base controller class includes the View() method along with other methods that return a particular types of result.
