Exception Handling in .NET Core


--What is exception handling in .NET core?
> Exception handling is one of the more important concept in application development.
> There are a couple of ways to handle exceptions in ASP.NET Core:
		*Exception Handling with Try-Catch block.
		*Global Exception Handling with Custom Middleware.

--Exception Handling with Try-Catch block
> The try block contains the code that may throw an exception and the catch block is the code that handles the exception if one occurs.
> The finally block is an optional block and runs whether there is an exception or not.

--Exception Handling with Custom Middleware
> Good and effective approach to handling the exception at the global level.
> The benefit of this approach is that we can catch all exceptions in one place and don't need to use a try-catch block in every action to catch errors.
> This is where we need to use Custom Middleware.
