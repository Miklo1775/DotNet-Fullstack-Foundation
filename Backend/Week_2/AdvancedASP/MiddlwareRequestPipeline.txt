Middleware Request Pipeline and Types


--What is the Middleware Request Pipeline?
> Request are processed beginning with request and ending with the response.
> The pipeline specifies how the application should respond to HTTP Requests.
> The request arriving from the browser goes throught the pipeline and back.
> The individual components that comprise the pipeline are called Middleware.

--Some types of Middleware
> Authentication
> Static File
> Routing
> Session
> Exception Handling
> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
> HTTPS Redirection

--How the Middleware Request Pipeline Works
> The HTTP request arrives at the application.
> The Kestrel web server picks up the requests and creates the httpContext and passes it to the first middleware in the requset pipeline.
> The first middleware then takes over, process request and passes it to the next middleware.
> This process goes on until the last middleware is reached.
> The last one returns the request back to the previous middleware, terminating the request pipeline.
> Finally, the response reaches kestrel, which returns the response back to the client.
> Any of the middleware in the request pipeline can terminate the request pipeline by simply not passing the request to the next middleware.
