Built-in And Custom Middleware


--What is Built-in Middleware
> Middleware that is built into ASP.NET Core

--What is Custom Middleware?
> Custom middleware is like any other .NET class with the invoke() method.
> However, in order to execute next middleware in a sequence, it should have RequestDelegate type parameter in the constructor.
> Custom middleware in .NET Core allows developers to execute code before or after request response cycle.
