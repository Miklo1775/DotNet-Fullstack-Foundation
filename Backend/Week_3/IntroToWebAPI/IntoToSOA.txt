Introduction to SOA


--What is SOA?
> Stands for Service Oriented Architecture.
> A stage in the evolution of application development and/or integration.
> Defines a way to make software components reusable using interfaces.
> In SOA, applications make use of services available in the network.
> Services are provided to form applications, through a network call over the internet.
> Uses common communication standards to speed up the service integrations in applications.
> The services are published in such a way that it makes it easy for the developers to assemble their apps using those services.
> SOA is different from microservice architecture.

--Benefits of SOA
> Reusability
> Greater adaptability
> Manage complexity
> Platform independent
> Loose coupling

--Uses of SOA
> Could be used to make a reliable service.
> Main use of SOA is to make a reusable service.
> Can be used for developing new function combinations.
> Highly flexible and simple to configure based on our needs.

--Service Connections
> There are 2 major roles within Service-oriented Architecture:
	*Service Provider
		=> The service provider is the mainainer of the service and the organization that makes available one or more services for others to use.
		=> To advertise services, the provider can publish them in a registry, together with a service contract that specifies the nature of the service, how to use it, the requirements for the service, and the fees charged.
	*Service Consumer
		=> The service consumer can locate the service metadata in the registry and develop the required client components to bind and use the service.
