Routing - Convention and Attribute Routing


--What is Convention Routing?
> Used for defining routes based on conventions and defaults rather than explicitly defining each route.
> Developers define a set of conventions that are used to generate routes for different types of controllers and actions.
> Provides a flexible and simple way to define routes in an ASP.NET Core application.
> URL pattern is generated based on the names of the controller and action methods.
> Example:
	*****
		app.useMvc(routes => 
		{
			routes.MapRoute(
				name: "default",
				template: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
				defaults: new {controller = "Home", action = "Index"}
			);
		})
	*****

--What is Attribute Routing?
> Technique used for defining routes directly in the controller using attributes.
> Devs can specify the URL pattern for a particular action method using attributes instead of relying on conventions or explicit route definitions.
> In attribute routing, [Route] is used to specify the URL pattern for an action method.
> By specifying the route directly in the controller code, developers can have fine-grained control over the URL patterns for each action method.
> Example:
	*****
		[Route("products/{id}")]
		public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
		{
			//code to retrieve product by id
		}
