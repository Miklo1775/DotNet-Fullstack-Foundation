Content Negotiation


--What is Content Negotiation?
> Whenever we consume an API, we receive data in either JSON or XML or plain text or your own custom format.
> This is simply Content Negotiation.
> Depending on the Accept header value in the request, the server sends the response.

--How Content Negotiation Works?
> There are two main headers which hold the responsibility of content negotiation:
	*Content-Type
	*Accept
> When a requester sends a service request, the Content-Type tells the responder the formet he will receive the data whereas the Accept header tells in which format the requester requires the data.
