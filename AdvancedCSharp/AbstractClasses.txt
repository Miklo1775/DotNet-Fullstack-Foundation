Abstract Classes

--What is an Abstract Class?
> A class that CANNOT be instantiated.
> Serves a base class for other classes to inherit from.
> Defines a common set of properties and methods that a derived class should have.
> The abstract keyword is used to define an abstract class.
> An abstract class can have both abstract methods and non-abstract methods.
> Example:
	****
		abstract class Test
		{
			//abstract method has no body
			public abstract void abstractMethod();

			public void nonAbstractMethod(){
				Console.WriteLine("Nonabstract method has body");
			}
		}
	****

--Abstract Methods
> A method that doesn't have a body.
> The abstract keyword is used to indicate an abstract method.
> A method that is declared but not defined in the base class, but is left to the derived class to implement.
> Can only be declared in an abstract class.
> Example: See above example of abstract class.
