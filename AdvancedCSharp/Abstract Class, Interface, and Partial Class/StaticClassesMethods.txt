Static Classes and Static Methods

--Static Class
> Static means something that cannot be instantiated.
> You cannot create an object of a static class.
> Cannot access static members using an object.
> Static classes cannot contain instance constructors.
> We use the static keyword before a class to make it static.
> Example:
	****
		static class ClassName
		{
			//static data members
			//static methods
		}
	****

--Static Class and Static Method
> Below example, class and all its members are static.
> Example:
	****
		public static class Calculator
		{
			private static int _resultStorage = 0;
			public static string Type = "Arithmetic";
			public static int Sum(int num1, int num2)
			{
				return num1 + num2;
			}

			public static void Store(int result)
			{
				_resultStorage = result;
			}
		}

--Advantages of a Static Class
> Error if you declare a member of a static class as nonstatic.
> Creating an instance of a static class generates compile-time error.
> Static members can be accessed directly with their class name.
> Static keyword is used before class keyword to declare a static class.
> Static class members are accessed by the class name followed by the member name.
