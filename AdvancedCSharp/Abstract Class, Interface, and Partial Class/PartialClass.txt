Partial Classes and Partial Methods

--What is a Partial Class?
> Unique feature of C#.
> Ability to split implementation of a class, a struct, a method, or an interface into multiple .cs files.
> Compiler will combine all implementations from multiple .cs files when the program is compiled.
> The partial keyword is used to build a partial class.
> Example:
	****
		public partial ClassName
		{
			//code
		}
	****

--Advatanges of Partial Class
> Multiple developers can work simultaneously in the same class in different files.
> Split UI of design to better read and understand the code.
> When working with automatically generated code.
> Code can be added to class without having to recreate the source file like in Visual Studio.
> Helps to maintain application in an efficient manner by compressing large classes into smaller one.

--Partial Methods
> Partial classes may contain partial methods.
> One part of the class contains the signature of the method.
> An optional implementation may be defined in the same part or another part.
> If implementation is not supplied, then method and all calls are removed at compile time.
> Both declaration and implementation of a method must have the partial keyword.
> Example:
	****
		partial void MethodName
		{
			// Code
		}
