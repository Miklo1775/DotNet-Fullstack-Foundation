Delegates


--What is a Delegate?
> A delegate is a pointer or reference to a method.
> It is object oriented, secured, and type-safe.
> A delegate essentially holds the address of a method which can be called using that delegate.
> For static methodds, delegate encapsulates method only.
> For instance methods, it encapsulates both instance and methods.
> Three steps involved while working with delegates:
	*Delcare a delegate.
	*Set a target method.
	*Invoke a delegate.\

--Types of Delegates
> Single Cast Delegates:
	*A single function or method is referred as a Delegate.
> Multi Cast Delegates:
	*Refers to the delegation of multiple functions of methods.
