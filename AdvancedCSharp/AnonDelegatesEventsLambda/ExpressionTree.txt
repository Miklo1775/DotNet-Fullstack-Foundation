Expression Tree


--What is an Expression Tree?
> Expressions arranged in a tree-like data structure.
> Each node in an expression tree is an expression.
> In-memory representation of a lambda expression.
> Holds the actual elements of the query, not the result of the query.
> Expression tree makes the structure of the lambda expression transparent and explicit.
> You can interact with the data in expression tree just as you can with any other data structure.
> Example:
	****

	Expression<TDelegate> name = lambdaExpression;

	****
> Can be created in the following ways:
	*Expression lambda
	*Expression Tree API

--Expression Tree Structure
> The simple structure of an Expression<TDelegate> has four properties:
	*Body ==> The body of the expression.
	*Parameters ==> The params of the lambda expression.
	*NodeType ==> The type of node in the tree.
	*Type ==> The type of expression.
