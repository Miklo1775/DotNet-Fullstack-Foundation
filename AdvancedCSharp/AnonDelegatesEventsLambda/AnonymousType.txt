Anonymous Types

--What is an Anonymous Types?
> Introduced in C# 3.0.
> Anonymous types allow us to create an object that has read-only properties.
> Anonymous object is an object that has no explicit type.
> C# compiler generates type name and is accessible only for the current block scope.
> Best for "use and throw" types.
> We create an anonymous type by using the new keyword with an object initializer.
> Example: 
	****

		var anonyInfo = new 
		{
			fname = "Chichi",
			lname = "Cheddar"
		}
		Console.WriteLine("Fname: " + anonyInfo.fname);
