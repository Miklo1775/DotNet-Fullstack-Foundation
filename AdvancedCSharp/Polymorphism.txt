Polymorphism

--What is Polymorphism?
> Greek word that means multiple forms or shapes.
> Use polymorphism if you want to have multiples forms of one or more methods of a class with the same name.
> In C#, Polymorphism can be achieved in a couple of ways:
		*Compile-time Polymorphism/Static Polymorphism
		*Runtime Polymorphism/Dynamic Polymorphism
> When a task if performed in different ways, that's Polymorphism.

--Compile-Time Polymorphism
> Compiler identifies which method is being called at compile time.
> Can be achieve in a couple of ways in C#:
		*Method Overloading
		*Constructor Overloading

--Method Overloading
> We create methods with the same name in a class if they have:
		*Different number of parameters.
		*Different types of parameters.
> Method overloading is also known as early binding or static binding because which method to call is decided at compile time, earlier than runtime.
> We can overload methods, constructors, and indexed properties.
> The reason is because these members have parameters only.
> Example:
	****
		class ConsolePrinter
		{
			public void Print(string str)
			{
				Console.WriteLine(str);
			}

			public void Print(string str1, string str2)
			{
				Console.WriteLine($"{str1} {str2}");
			}

			public void Print(string str1, string str2, string str3 )
			{
				Console.WriteLine($"{str1} {str2} {str3}");
			}
		}
	****

--Method Overriding
> Derived class defines the same method as defined in its base class.
> It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
> Enables us to provide implementation of a method which is already provided by it's base class.
> We need to use virtual keyword with base class method and override keyword with derived class method.
> Examples:
	****
		class Animal
		{ 
			publiv virtual void MakeSound()
			{
				Console.WriteLine("This animal makes a sound.");
			}
		}

		class Cat : Animal 
		{
			public override void MakeSound()
			{
				Console.WriteLine("The cat goes meow!");
			}
		}
