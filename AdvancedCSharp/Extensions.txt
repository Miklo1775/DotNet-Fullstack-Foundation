Extension Methods

--What are Extension Methods?
> They are additional methods.
> These methods create and add new methods to existing classes without create a new child class.
> They are a special type of static methods that can also be called instance methods.
> We can add extension methods in both predefined and user defined custom classes.
> Things to consider:
		*An extension method should be a static method.
		*It must have this keyword associated with class name.
		*The class name should be the first parameter in the parameter list.
