Properties

--What is a Property?
> A class member that exposes the class' private fields.
> Internally, C# properties are special methods called accessors.
> 2 accessors, a get property and a set property AKA getters and setters.
> A get accessor returns a property value, a set accessor assigns a new value.
> The value keyword represents the value of a property.
> The general form of declaring a property is as follows:
	****
		{
			get{ }
			set{ }
		}
	****

--Usage of Properties
> C# Properties can be read-only or write-only.
> We can have logic while setting values in the C# Properties.
> We make fields of a class private so that fields can't be accessed from outside the class directly.

--Types of Properties
> Read-Write ==> get; set;
> Read-Only ==> get;
> Write-Only ==> set;
> Auto-Implemented ==> get; set;
